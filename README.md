# Data Processing AI Model

A sophisticated Python-based data processing model that integrates multiple APIs to aggregate and preprocess raw data from various sources. The model leverages AI algorithms to transform the data into refined, backend-ready formats, optimizing its utility for advanced applications.

## Features

- **Data Aggregation**: Collects raw data from diverse sources through API integration.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and structures the aggregated data for consistency and quality.
- **AI-Powered Transformation**: Applies AI algorithms to convert preprocessed data into formats suitable for backend systems.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently.
- **Extensibility**: Modular architecture allows easy integration of additional data sources and processing techniques.

## Installation
